# Noise Cancelling Adapter

This project was targeting a cost reduced noise cancelling adapter which will cancel the ambient noise 
up to a certain level. Any headphone can be connected to the adapter and the adapter should be 
connected to the audio port of the device we are using. Then we have to switch on the adapter so that 
we can hear the music with noise reduced.  

Existing noise cancelling headphones in the market are quite expensive. If a person has a normal 
headphone and he wants a noise cancelling headphone, that person has to buy an separate 
headphone to it. It is a waste of money. Considering all these factors, I decided to design a noise 
cancelling adapter to convert a normal headphone to a noise cancelling headphone. Since this is only 
an adapter it will be able to make this at lower cost.
